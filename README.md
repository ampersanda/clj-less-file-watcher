# less-file-watcher 

This file watcher inspired by Jetbrains' File Watcher
I am using IntelliJ IDEA Community and I can't use it anymore (I used to use the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate)

You have to install `lessc` and `less-plugin-clean-css` using `npm` before use this file watcher

[x] Compile LESS
[ ] Compile related/imported less file from the parent of less file, for example, `home.less` is used by `amp.less`, `home.less` is compiled and `amp.less` is compiled too or just compile `amp.less` (opinion needed)
[ ] Standalone executable bin file (use lein-bin)
[ ] Access via `plugin`
[ ] Access via `dependecies`
